## Simple Single Page Application

### Background

This is a template for a single page application written in vanilla Javascript. It builds off of FermiDirak's SPA router, which is by far the cleanest implementation out there. You can check out his repository at https://github.com/FermiDirak/fermidirak.github.io. Lot's more info on the way! In a big hurry right now!
